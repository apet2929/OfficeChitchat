STATES:
State is an abstract class that provides this template:
    1) Each state will have 4 methods: an Update, a Render, an OnEnter, and an OnExit method.
    2) Each state will contain a Group.
        a) In the OnEnter method, the scene's parent will be set to the state group.
The StateMachine is a high-level object that will handle the adding and switching between of these states.
    1) It will have only 1 active state at a time
    2) It will contain a list of all possible states
    3) It will call the active state's render and update methods
When adding a new state to the StateMachine, you must provide a state and a string to identify the state by, which will be used when changing states.
